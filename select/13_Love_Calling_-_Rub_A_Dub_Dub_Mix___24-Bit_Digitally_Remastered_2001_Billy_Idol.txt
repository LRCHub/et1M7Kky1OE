Ooh baby, rock on
Clap hands, clap hands
For the song man
Rock on, rock on

Ooh baby, rock on
Clap hands, clap hands
For the song man
Rock on, rock on
Ooh baby, rock

Song man dreams for you
Moves his clapping space
Turns us into snakes
Hot hits
And the blue moon move, move, move
Move until we die
Move until she cries

If you want to rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you want to rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling, love calling
If you want to rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you want to rub-a-dub, dub love

(Love calling)
(Love calling)

If you want to rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you want to rub-a-dub, dub love
Love calling (love calling)
Love calling (love calling)

If you want to rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
If you want to rub-a-dub, dub love (love calling)
Rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
Rub-a-dub, dub love
Rub-a-dub, rub-a-dub
Rub-a-dub, dub love (love calling)

Ooh baby rock on
Clap hands, clap hands
For the song man
Rock on, rock on
Ooh baby, rock on

Rock on
Rock on
Rock on
Rock on
Rock on

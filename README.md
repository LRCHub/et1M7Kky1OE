It's been three years
and six whole months
Since I saw your face that night
It took five seconds
to fall in love
And two more to make you mine
Now it's four in the morning,
suns set and
Seven minutes with you
and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by
I love you 24/7, 365
Give you my name,
if you wanted to
Key to my heart
if you want it too
And I hope and pray
that you'll stay right here
'Til we're old and gray
in our last few years
I'm on a knee I just need a yes
A couple kids and a picket fence
Share the memories
like an open book
Every page
I read it still got me hooked
And I'm fine spending
my whole life on everything
you like
Is it obvious that
all of this is right?
'Cause it's been three years
and six whole months
Since I saw your face that night
It took five seconds
to fall in love
And two more to make you mine
Now it's four in the morning,
suns set and
Seven minutes with you
and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by
I love you 24/7, 365
I'll share the last bite of
every meal
I'll wipe your tears
when you're in your feels
And I'll hold you close
through a thunderstorm
When it's cold at night know
I'll keep you warm
'Cause I'm fine spending
my whole life on everything
you like
Is it obvious that
all of this is right?
'Cause it's been three years
and six whole months
Since I saw your face that night
It took five seconds
to fall in love
And two more to make you mine
Now it's four in the morning,
suns set and
Seven minutes with you
and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by
I love you 24/7, 365
I love you 24/7, 365
Now it's four in the morning,
suns set and
Seven minutes with you
and it's heaven
Ain't an hour that rolls by
I love you 24/7, 365
